# google_sign_in_example broken

This is a sort of "Fork" of the original flutter Google Sign In Plugin Example app.

(Flutters Repo)[https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_sign_in]

As you can see, I've added a first and second Screen.

The app starts in the first screen, to login you press the button to go to the second screen. Then you can go back the first screen.

## Problems
Upon opening the app, it is possible to sign in with google once. When you go back to first screen after that and then open the second again, the login information, disspears and a login is no longer possible, until you restart the app.


### Please Note
I'm a beginner in Flutter and like it very much.
Either I'm not capable to use the navigator the right way or this really is a bug in the plugin.

I'm open to suggestions, anyone is welcome to help me with this issue!
